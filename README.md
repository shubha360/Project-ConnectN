# Project-ConnectN
This Java-made console version of **[Connect 4](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html)** game.

But instead of sticking with the traditional number 4 as the winning number, this version of the game lets the player set any number as the winning number. The numbers of rows and columns of the playing grid can also be modified.

## Behind The Program

I was given this programming project by a client from freelancing marketplace. The main file was already implemented by someone. My task was to read the documentation from the [index file](https://github.com/shubha360/Project-ConnectN/blob/main/javadocs/index.html) and implement the main game logics according to the documentation.

Here are screenshots of the game - 

(Player 2 won by matching the diagonals. The winning number is set to 5.)
